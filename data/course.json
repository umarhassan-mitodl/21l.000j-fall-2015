  "course_description": "This course is designed around analyzing _intimate bonds_ and the permutations of _heartbreak_. Through the analysis of a set of relations in novels, short stories, poetry, music videos, and live theatre, we will consider the transformative states of the lover\u2019s (un)becoming, for how consciousness is constituted by bonds yet how the lover transcends crisis in the moment of the epiphany that surfaces in love\u2019s very failure; indeed, love itself becomes narcissistically yet optimistically illuminating, even in its oppressive hold.\n",
