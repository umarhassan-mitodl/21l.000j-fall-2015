This writing assignment, like the others, is a short and focused exercise in _close reading_. Only 250 words are required; however, this is enough for you to work on a small piece of text in _Beloved_ and in _detail_. I am not selecting a passage for you; instead, you’ll be responsible for selecting a passage you deem is significant. Then, examine it and analyze it just as you had with a single panel in _Fun Home_. Stay focused. And, like your previous close reading for _Fun Home_, craft one paragraph that follows the thinking provided in our last few class sessions on developing a body paragraph. The objective at this point is for you to more fully develop a _sustained textual analysis_ with a primary text, but also, for me to see your progress: are your writing skills improving or perhaps you are not yet understanding the importance of _rewriting_ – that is, spending 2-3 days, one day drafting, the second day returning to the draft to rewrite it and possibly a third day to polish it. Some of you are showing progress, while others are struggling to catch up.
