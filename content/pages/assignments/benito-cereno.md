This writing assignment, like the others, is a short and focused exercise in _close reading_. Only 250 words are required; however, this is enough for you to work on a small piece of text in _Benito Cereno_ and in _detail_. I am not selecting a passage for you; instead, you’ll be responsible for selecting a passage you deem interesting. Place the quotation at the top of the page, as an epigraphic quotation. Then, examine it and analyze it as you’ve done with previous close reading assignments. My advice (again): **Stay focused with the epigraphic quotation**. I am asking that you craft one paragraph as a **body paragraph** you might insert into an essay. The objective is for you to develop a _sustained textual analysis_ with a scene/moment of the primary text, but also, for me to continue following your progress.

*   Are your writing skills improving? Is your analysis of text moving from summary to critical analysis? Have you grasped the importance of _rewriting_?

Because you have an entire week, you’ll want to return to this piece of writing at least three times before turning it in on session 17. Spend one day **drafting** (an hour +), the second day **rewriting** (an hour +) and possibly a third day **polishing** (an hour). Some of you are showing progress, while others are struggling, and this is often attributed to students waiting until the night before the assignment is due to begin writing.
