In preparation for our attendance of the musical {{% resource_link "a64f9f3d-0faa-41cc-8e6e-b8f046a178d1" "_Waitress_" %}} at the {{% resource_link "432a02f9-2ad0-48bb-800d-c80ef76cc034" "American Repertory Theater at Harvard" %}}, your writing assignment is to find a pie recipe – yes, a recipe of a pie! Be daring and clever. You might select a special one, your favorite, your mom’s favorite, your dad’s favorite, a friend’s favorite. I’ll ask each of you to share with the class why it is that you selected that pie recipe.

For inspiration, watch the two video clips below, pertaining to the musical _Waitress_. The first video is a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the background and story of the musical, though we’ll talk more in class of the production and its characters. My favorite line in this video is when Sara Bareilles admits, “I think, everyone can relate to the idea of sort of waking up and seeing their lives having happened around them and almost wondering, ‘How did I get here?'"

The second video is the main musical number for the show called “She Used to Be Mine” – it is carefully emotional. Listen to it and let yourself fall into the melody of the piano and the lament and nostalgia in the lyrics. If anything, let the song guide you as you find your pie recipe and begin thinking about what you might say to the class as to why that pie of all pies.

I look forward to reading your revised essays and curious to know what pie you’ll each select to share.
