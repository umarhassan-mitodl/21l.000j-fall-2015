_A few words to get the wheels turning, that's all ..._

In class we read the essay, entitled “Running the Table,” by Frank Conroy. Together we pursued a reading that traced its _autobiographical narrative_ elements, in addition to discussing the possibility that the first-person narration could very well be an _unreliable narrator_. Thus, central to our concluding thoughts were the final line of the essay: “But a bit of Julian’s is still with me and, at the very least, I talk a good game.” We might ask, is the essay a mere performance of knowledge (that is, a voice knowledgeable of the discourse of pool) or is what is written on the page a real experience? Remember, “I talk a good game” carries many layers, as one of you so aptly pointed out.

For this writing assignment then, I am asking you to imitate this essay in the form of your own love letter—that is, pick an object or thing of desire (as Conroy picked pool) and in 250 words (or more) “talk a good game” for your reader, whomever it may be that this love letter is addressed to.

Things to consider:

*   You might include narrative moves like Conroy’s, such as his reflective moment in the opening line (“When I was fifteen and living in New York City”) or incorporate an abrupt transition (“Sometime in the late sixties, as an adult”), and maybe even whispers to the reader: “(He is a poet).” Please also venture outwards if you’ve discovered different patterns, other strategies, interesting tropes, or thought of your own idioms.
*   Imagine yourself knowing/loving an object in terms of _caring for it_ versus _winning it_: Conroy cares so much more about pool than he does about winning a game. This difference is essential to understanding how an affinity for an object shapes identity. Ultimately, the love for an object reveals something about Conroy’s character and who he became.
*   Allow yourself some room on the page for _writerly play_ (be descriptive in terms of allowing your reader to _hear_ what it is that you’re writing and even _feel_ the experience in the words you use).
*   Perhaps you might create your own parallel, such as Conroy’s between pool (physical experience, the practice) and the Botanic Garden (meditative, ritualistic).

As you write, however, note that this writing assignment isn’t about you needing to read Conroy’s essay over and over—that’s not what this assignment is asking for. Instead, borrow his _writerly moves_ to create your own playful essay into a love letter. Again, your writing this letter is a performative act. Essentially, I want to learn something about you and how you write, especially when I say there are no boundaries. All you need to do is “talk a good game.” And remember, this is a love letter so it should _look_ like a love letter—with "Dear So and So, ... " and perhaps you might end it with "Love, ... " Or maybe not. Be creative. Remember our theme is love, just take us elsewhere with it, tell us something powerful about _who you are_ in an object you love, and then bring us back.

Useful vocabulary:

*   _Autobiographical narrative_
*   _Unreliable narrator_
